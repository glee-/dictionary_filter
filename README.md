A solver created initially for wordelicious. https://ludipe.itch.io/wordelicious

Usage:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the solver using python solver.py

Notes:
Specifically requires the use of python3 due to the use of input() versus raw_input() when handling input from stdin.

Reads directly from the dictionary within the same directory labeled words.txt.
